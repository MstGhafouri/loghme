### A MERN Stack web-app

**This project is built using modern technologies**:

- `React & Redux`
- `Typescript`
- `Node & Express`
- `MongoDB & Mongoose`
- `Bootstrap`
- `Sass`
- And more!

This web app was originally built for internet engineering course assignment, but i personally added more features to it.

**This project consists of a lot of modern and advanced features like**:
- [x] User authentication & authorization (`jsonWebToken`, `password reset`, ...)
- [x] Integrating `Google Sign in`
- [x] Sending `emails` with Sendgrid
- [x] Advanced `searching`, `filtering` and `pagination`
- [x] `Ordering food` and assigning a `delivery` to it
- [ ] And some more...!

Of course no project is free of defects. And as usual, there is always a room for improvement.
